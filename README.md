Fourier Transform in C++

http://4errors.com/how-to-implement-fourier-transform-in-c-programming

The intention is to make a C++ Fourier library for all the different algorithms used for Fourier Transforms.

At the moment the repo contains a program with FFT and inverse FFT functions implemented in C++.

There are two purposes of doing this.

1. To provide a standard library for Fourier algorithms in C++.
2. To use the library to present a comparison study of all the algorithms with different sizes of inputs.

Open for Suggestions and Corrections.
